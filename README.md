# EasyMCU

It’s a Java GUI based on easy user experience and user interface with the program to facilitate the usage of a program for beginner users in the Embedded System Field, especially in the AVR Microcontrollers family.

The system has several advantages as the following:

• This system is developed to configure the header files of the microcontroller drivers with just a few mouse clicks.

• Avoid the problem of incompatibility between drivers configuration like if you configure a Port A0 pin as Output in DIO driver header file and then you configure it as Input in ADC header file, then there is a problem will happen because of incompatibility.

• Autogenerate for a ready-to-use code based on which MCAL peripheral you will use.

• the ready-to-use code will avoid the forgetfulness problem for some essential functions like Initialization and Enable functions.

• Avoid using peripherals that depend on other peripherals such as, using the external interrupt without enabling the general interrupt.

• Providing an AVR calculator that Enhanced usage experience and doing some functions like calculating the timers registers value by the actual time.

• Finally making your folder containing your configured driver header files and the main function ready for you with all the functions you will need.
